<h2>General / Requirements</h2><p>
All our code is available on <a href="https://github.com/tb2332/MSongsDB">github</a>.<p>
Files are in HDF5 format. Why? See FAQ.
You need the HDF5 library to use the dataset 
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/">here</a>.
Other requirements depend on the language you use, see the foillowing
section.<p>
We believe that more than 90% of the researchers using the dataset will not
need to understand the structure of the HDF5 files. Therefore, the wrappers
below simply provide getters to the different fields saved in each file.
If you really want to speed things up and want to play with HDF5, we
have some code to aggregate many files into one (thus saving on IO operations!).
Want to dig deeper? All our code is open source, the HDF5 file descriptors
are available in python, see the latter section on Dataset Creation.

<h2>Wrappers</h2><p>
<h3>Python</h3>
The HDF5 wrapper in python is <a href="http://www.pytables.org/moin">pytables</a>.
If you just want to use the HDF5 provided in the dataset, the file
hdf5_getters.py should be enough. If you want a deeper understanding of the
dataset, or want to combine many files into one, see the section on
dataset creation below. All our work was done in python.

<h3>Matlab</h3>
MATLAB requires no additional libraries. We created the basic getters
through this class.

<h3>Java</h3>
You need some JAR files accessible <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/">here</a>. Read the README file, but the class hdf5_getters.java should give
you all you need.

<h3>C/C++</h3>
We do not have these wrappers for the moment. That being said, HDF5 is
a C library and we have some testing code in C++, it is definitely feasible.
If you need these for your application, let us know, we'll work on it!

<h2>Dataset Creation</h2><p>
Here is the python code used to create the dataset.
Note that we add an unrestricted access to the Echo
Nest API, but nothing special other than that.
