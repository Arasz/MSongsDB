<h2>About the Million Song Dataset</h2><p>
The Million Song Dataset is a collaborative project between the Echo
Nest and LabROSA at Columbia University. The main goals are:<br />
<ol>
<li>providing a large dataset to encourage algorithms that scale to
commercial sizes</li>
<li>setting a reference dataset to report results on in academic
papers</li>
<li>easing the task of downloading a large dataset using APIs</li>
<li>helping new researchers in the MIR field getting started</li>
</ol>
NO AUDIO IS PROVIDED HERE. The core of the dataset is the analysis of a
million songs and metadata provided by the Echo Nest (note that audio
samples can be fetched from services like 7digital, code provided).<br />
