<a name='whatisindataset'><h3>What is in the dataset?</h3></a>
Good question, a lot of things.<p>

<a name='whatisformat'><h3>What is the format?</h3></a>
Each file represents one track with all the related information
(artist information, release information, audio analysis of the track, etc).
Usually one track is one song, though we added several tracks representing
the same song in case someone wants to measure the variability.
In this rare case, the tracks arevery similar but not identical. A typical
reason for this is two different releases of a same album (USA and Europe
versions?).<br>
The actual file format of each file is <a href='#hdfwhat'>HDF5</a>.<p>

<a name='hdfwhat'><h3>HDF what?</h3></a>
HDF5! Why? Because! (regarding this, all coplains should definitely
go to tb2332@columbia.edu). In short, <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> 
is a format developped by NASA to handle 1) large 2) heterogeneous 3)
hierarchical datasets. The data can be compressed, and the I/O speed
is impressive. Also note that the core library comes free of charge and
wrappers exist in most languages (see "code" section).<br>
Is is perfect? No. Does it make more sense that 1M zipped json files or
matfiles? Yes. Still not happy? Here ????? is a python code to transform the
data into matfiles.<p>

<a name='filepaths'><h3>What are the file paths?</h3></a>
We could not put a million files in one dataset. Even a few thousands
can slow your operating system significantly. We used the track ID
from the Echo Nest which can be viewed as a hash code. It is always
TR+LETTERS+LETTERS&NUMBERS. The path is the 3rd, 4th, 5th letters
from the track ID, the file itself is named after its track ID + the
extension ".h5".<p>

<a name='whatcanido'><h3>What can I do with this data?</h3></a>
Surprise us! But you might want a take a look at the "tasks"
section to get inspired. You will also find there some snippets
of code that let's you easily crawl through the whole data.<p>

<a name='howtoorganize'><h3>How do I get it organized?</h3></a>
Gordon!<p>

<a name='whatlicense'><h3>What is the licensing?</h3></a>
GNU Public License? If you're a researcher and want to publish,
you are fine. If you are a company and want to experiment on the
dataset, contact the Echo Nest, we will probably give you the
authorization.<p>

<a name='wherehelp'><h3>Where can I get help?</h3></a>
There is no mailing or user blog so far. Simply contact one
of the creator at LabROSA or the Echo Nest, see the "contact us"
section.<p>
