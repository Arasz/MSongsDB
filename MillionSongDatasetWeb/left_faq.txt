Good question, a lot of things.

Surprise us! But you might want a take a look at the "tasks"

GNU Public License? If you're a researcher and want to publish,
you are fine. If you are a company and want to experiment on the
dataset, contact the Echo Nest, we will probably give you the
authorization.
