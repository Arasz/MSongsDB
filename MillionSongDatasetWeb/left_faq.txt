<a name='whatisindataset'><h3>What is in the dataset?</h3></a>
Good question, a lot of things. Mostly, almost all information
provided by the Echo Nest API which encompasses both metadata
and audio analysis. Each file is for one track which corresponds
to one song, one release and one artist. All the information about
these four items (track, song, release, artist) are in every file
(yes, there is redundancy).<br>
For an in depth look, go to the following
section describing all <a href='#fields'>fields</a> you will find
in one song file. Note that the data is quite complete, but some fields
might be missing for some songs. For instance, we don't know the location
for all artists.<p>

<a name='fields'><h3>Fields description</h3></a>
Below are a list of all fields available in the files of the dataset.
The real reference is the code:
<a href="https://github.com/tb2332/MSongsDB/blob/master/PythonSrc/display_song.py">
display_song.py</a>. If a field is displayed, the field exists
and there should be a getter for it (if I forgot some in matlab or java,
please let me know).
For the analysis field, we suggest you first read the Echo Nest
<a href='http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/_static/AnalyzeDocumentation_2.2.pdf'>analyze documentation</a>.

<a name='gettingdataset'><h3>How to get the dataset?</h3></a>
See section <a onClick="clientSideInclude('left','left_getting.txt');" href='#'>Getting the dataset</a>.<p>
<a name='notapi'><h3>Why is it not an API?</h3></a>
API have a lot of merit, and most of this dataset was built using
the Echo Nest API (with unlimited access). But APIs have not
solved all research problems, and there is a place for such a fixed
dataset. Everyone gets the same data and can report results on the same
songs and features. Also, it facilitates the download. It is not because
an API exists that one gets through the trouble of downloading a million
songs.<br>
That being said, this dataset and API can be complementary. This is why
we made sure we provided enough metadata such as musicbrainz ID so everyone
can link this data to other existing resources.<p>

<a name='whatisformat'><h3>What is the format?</h3></a>
Each file represents one track with all the related information
(artist information, release information, audio analysis of the track, etc).
Usually one track is one song, though we added several tracks representing
the same song in case someone wants to measure the variability.
In this rare case, the tracks are very similar but not identical. A typical
reason for this is two different releases of a same album (USA and Europe
versions?). Here is the list of songs that have multiple tracks and
the code ???? used to find them.<br>
The actual file format of each file is <a href='#hdfwhat'>HDF5</a>.<p>

<a name='hdfwhat'><h3>HDF what?</h3></a>
HDF5! Why? Because! (regarding this, all complains should definitely
go to tb2332@columbia.edu). In short, <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> 
is a format developped by NASA to handle 1) large 2) heterogeneous 3)
hierarchical datasets. The data can be compressed (10%-15% more that matfiles), 
and the I/O speed is still impressive. Also note that the core library comes free of charge and
wrappers exist in most languages (see "code" section).<br>
Is is perfect? No. Does it make more sense that 1M zipped json files or
matfiles? Yes. 
Note that the new matfile format (v7.3) is 
<a href="http://mloss.org/community/blog/2009/nov/19/matlabtm-73-file-format-is-actually-hdf5-and-can-b/">
actually HDF5</a>.<br>
Still not happy? Here is a 
<a href="https://github.com/tb2332/MSongsDB/blob/master/PythonSrc/hdf5_to_matfile.py">python code</a> 
or a 
<a href="https://github.com/tb2332/MSongsDB/blob/master/MatlabSrc/hdf5_to_matfile.m">matlab code</a> 
to transform the data into matfiles (the latter is less tested, strings seem wrongly encoded).<p>


<a name='aggregate'><h3>song / aggregate / summary files</h3></a>
We usually use song file to refer to the typical HDF5 file that contains
the information for only one song. An aggregate file is also an HDF5 file,
but that contains the information of many songs. It is usefull if you do
I/O intensive experiments, as it reduce the number of open/close file
operations you need to perform. A summary file is similar to an
aggregate file, but contains just the metadata, i.e. we remove all
the big tables like the analysis (bars, beats, segments, ...).
Usefull if you want to quickly search the metadata, a lot of space is
saved!<br>
Note on summary files, if you're using the code 
<a href="https://github.com/tb2332/MSongsDB/blob/master/PythonSrc/display_song.py">
display_song.py</a>, you need the '-summary' flag to tell the code 
that some getters won't find their field, e.g. bars_start.<br>
The dataset you received should contain one million song files.
You can create aggregate and/or summary files using the python scripts.
<p>


<a name='utf8'><h3>Why strings do not display correctly?</h3></a>
All data was downloaded in utf-8 format and was saved in the HDF5
file in utf-8 format. Does it mean every name / release / title
should display correctly if you set your display to utf-8? We sure
hope so, but in practice some string with uncommon elements will never 
be correctly recorded. Conclusion: use the strings like titles and artist
names as indications, the real identifiers should be the musicbrainz ID
or the echonest ID.<p>

<a name='visualize'><h3>How can I visualize a file?</h3></a>
We mean quickly glance at the content of a file.
Once again, it depends on the language you want to use, and you
need the HDF5 library installed (see "code" section). In python
(with <a href='http://www.pytables.org/'>pytables</a> installed), 
use display_songs.py????. In Java, you can use the great tool 
<a href=http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/hdfview/index.html>HDFVIEW</a>.<p>

<a name='filepaths'><h3>What are the file paths?</h3></a>
We could not put a million files in one folder. Even a few thousands
can slow your operating system significantly. We used the track ID
from the Echo Nest which can be viewed as a hash code. It is always
TR+LETTERS+LETTERS&NUMBERS. The path is the 3rd, 4th, 5th letters
from the track ID, the file itself is named after its track ID + the
extension ".h5".<p>

<a name='whatcanido'><h3>What can I do with this data?</h3></a>
Surprise us! But you might want a take a look at the "tasks"
section to get inspired. You will also find there some snippets
of code that let's you easily crawl through the whole data.<p>

<a name='howtoorganize'><h3>How do I get it organized?</h3></a>
Gordon! more to come on this.<p>

<a name='howcreated'><h3>How wasthe dataset created?</h3></a>
Using the Echonest API. Songs were chosen....?????
FOr more techincal details, see "dataset creation" in "code" section.<p>

<a name='whatlicense'><h3>What is the licensing?</h3></a>
GNU Public License? If you're a researcher and want to publish,
you are fine. If you are a company and want to experiment on the
dataset, contact the Echo Nest, we will probably give you the
authorization.<p>

<a name='website'><h3>Why this website doesn't load sometimes?</h3></a>
You need to enable javascript. We also use a 'non-official' javascript
function that loads external HTML from the client side.
This should be supported on the following recent browsers: IE, firefox,
chrome, safari, opera. If you still have issues, send us an email.<br>
Our university server isn't perfect either.<p>

<a name='wherehelp'><h3>Where can I get help?</h3></a>
There is no mailing or user blog so far. Simply contact one
of the creator at LabROSA or the Echo Nest, see the "contact us"
section.<p>

<a name='getinvolved'><h3>How can I get involved?</h3></a>
Simple! Use the dataset and share your code. We will be happy
to put it on this website. Also, put on your website the list of songs 
(e.g. their musicbrainz id) you use when you publish something.
With a simple list of IDs in a text file, one can recreate a test
set in a few minutes, and compare results with his own algorithm!<p>
