Our main goal is to provide the data because researchers will know what 
they want to do with it. That being said, we give some information regarding
typical MIR tasks below. We hope to provide snippets of code and benchmarks
results to help you getting started. If you want to provide additional
information / link to your code / new results, please send us an email!
