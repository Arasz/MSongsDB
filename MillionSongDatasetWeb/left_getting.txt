<h2>Getting the dataset</h2><p>
The dataset is around 300 gb, which makes it difficult to share.
<p>
First, here are the <a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/millionsong/files/one_track_description.pdf">
details</a> of what you will find in a typical file of
this dataset, in this case this 
<a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/millionsong/files/TRAXLZU12903D05F94.h5">one</a>.
<p>
Then, below is a subset of 10000 random songs (1.8 gb) so you can get started:<br>
<a href="http://www.adrive.com/public/19e134041e55d794ee849b7cf03c5ae7423ee16a6b1f0a0c54f977300e8c525f.html">MILLION SONG SUBSET</a> (the link might
expire, send me an <a href="mailto:tb2332@columbia.edu">email</a> it it happens).
<p>
To get the whole dataset, first see if you know someone that has it!
We have sent hard drives with the data to labs at UCSD, QMUL
and UPF among others. We might be able to send
other disks on request.
<p>
<h3>infochimps</h3><p>
The whole dataset is available through infochimps url=??????.

<p>
<h3>Amazon Public Datasets</h3><p>
The dataset should be hosted on 
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/">aws public datasets</a>,
with probably an option to download it, or you can work on it directly
using Amazon Web Services url=????.
<p>
<h3>Still can not get it?</h3><p>
If for some reason, none of the methods above work, please contact us
and we will figure out another way to do the transfer. For instance,
we can bring an external drive at conferences (e.g. ISMIR, WASPAA, ICASSP, ...).
<p>
Note on the content of the dataset, if you just want a list of songs
contained in it, below is a text file with that information.
<p>
<h2>Useful Additional Files</h2><p>
To help you get started we provide additional files, mostly different
reverse indices:
<ol>
<li>List of all track Echo Nest ID
<a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/millionsong/files/unique_tracks.txt">here</a>.
The format is:<br>
track id&lt;SEP&gt;song id&lt;SEP&gt;artist name&lt;SEP&gt;song title<br>
(Careful, large to open in a web browser)
</li>
<li>List of all artist ID
<a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/millionsong/files/unique_artists.txt">here</a>.
    The format is:<br>
    artist id&lt;SEP&gt;artist mbid&lt;SEP&gt;track id&lt;SEP&gt;artist name<br>
    The code to recreate that file is available
    <a href="https://github.com/tb2332/MSongsDB/blob/master/Tasks_Demos/NamesAnalysis/list_all_artists.py">
    here</a> (and a faster version using the SQLite databases
    <a href="https://github.com/tb2332/MSongsDB/blob/master/Tasks_Demos/SQLite/list_all_artists_from_db.py">
    here</a>).</li>
<li>List of all unique artist terms (Echo Nest tags)
<a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/millionsong/files/unique_terms.txt">here</a>.
</li>
<li>List of all unique artist musicbrainz tags
<a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/millionsong/files/unique_mbtags.txt">here</a>.
</li>
<li> List of the 515.576 tracks for which we have the year information, ordered by year,
<a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/millionsong/files/tracks_per_year.txt">here</a>.
</li>
<li> List of artists for which we know latitude and longitude
<a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/millionsong/files/artist_location.txt">here</a>.
</li>
<li>Summary file of the whole dataset, meaning same HDF5 format as regular files,
it contains all metadata but no arrays like audio analysis,
similar artists and tags. Most efficient I/O, only 300 Mb, available
<a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/millionsong/files/msd_summary_file.h5">here</a>.
</li>
<li>SQLite database containing most metadata about each track 
<a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~thierry/track_metadata.db">here</a>.
</li>
<li>SQLite database linking artist ID to the tags (Echo Nest and musicbrainz ones)
<a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~thierry/artist_term.db">here</a>.
</li>
<li>SQLite database containing similarity among artists
<a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~thierry/artist_similarity.db">here</a>.
</li>
</ol>
The code to create these lists is usually available in one of the different
/Tasks_Demos/ folders when you download the code.
<p>
<h2>MLcomp</h2><p>
A subset of the data will be made available on <a href="http://mlcomp.org/">
MLcomp</a>. It is difficult to say how results will translate to the larger
dataset, but it is definitely a way to get an intuition on which algorithm
appears to work better.
