<h2>Getting the dataset</h2><p>
The dataset is around 300 MB. We do not have access to servers that
can distribute this load (we are looking at online solutions like
<a href="http://www.onlinestoragesolution.com/index.html">this</a>). 
But we want you to get the dataset! Below
is a subset of ??? songs so you can get started.

Then, we have some hard drives with the dataset on it ready to be sent.
Please send us an email with your lab coordinates, and we should be able
to arrange something. The dataset can also fit on a couple of DVD.
<p>
Finally, if you have space on your lab servers to host such a dataset,
please let us know! A solution involving a few bittorrent servers might
also be viable.

Note on the content of the dataset, if you just want a list of songs
contained in it, here is a text file with that information: ????
