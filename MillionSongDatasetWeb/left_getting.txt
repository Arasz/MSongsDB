<h2>Getting the dataset</h2><p>
The dataset is around 300 MB. Below
is a subset of ??? songs so you can get started.
<p>

<p>
To get the whole dataset, first see if you know someone that has it!
We have sent hard drives with the data to labs at UCSD, Queen Mary
University in London and UPF among others. We might be able to send
other disks on request.
<p>
You can download it from Amazon, cost is around 40$. Send us an
email, and we will forward you a link valid for 24 hours. This
is the best solution in terms of speed / cost / simplicity. The cost
is solely Amazaon's banwdwith, we do not receive any money!
You can also access the dataset directly on Amazon Web Services
(<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2 service</a>) as the
dataset will be hosted on 
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/">aws public datasets</a>.
<p>
On demand, we can consider a ssh transfer from our lab server.
You must have a good connection that can stay open for days!
Also, if your final goal is to buy and put the data on an external
hard drive, you can buy it and send it to us through 
<a href="http://amzn.com/B003ICWB5Y">Amazon</a>.
We'll fill the drive and send it back to you. Contact us to know
where to send it to here at Columbia.
<p>
We can bring such a device at conferences (e.g. ISMIR, WASPAA, ICASSP, ...)!
If you will attend one of these soon and would like the dataset,
let us know, and we'll figure out a way to de to the transfer there.
<p>
Finally, if you have space on your lab servers to host such a dataset,
please let us know! A solution involving a few bittorrent servers might
also be viable.
<p>
Note on the content of the dataset, if you just want a list of songs
contained in it, here is a text file with that information: ????

<h2>Useful Additional Files</h2><p>
To help you get started we provide additional files, mostly different
reverse indecies:
<ol>
<li>List of all track Echo Nest ID ????</li>
<li>List of all artist ID ????. The format is:<br>
    artist id&lt;SEP&gt;artist mbid&lt;SEP&gt;track id&lt;SEP&gt;artist name<br>
    The code to recreate that file is available ?????.</li>
<li>List of all unique artist terms ????</li>
<li>SQLite database containing most metadata about each track ????</li>
<li>SQLite database linking artist ID to the most used tags ????</li>
</ol>
The code to create these lists is usually available in one of the different
/Tasks_Demos/ folders when you download the code.<p>
